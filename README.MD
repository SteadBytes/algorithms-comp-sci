# Algorithms
This repository contains my work/notes/code for learning Algorithms in Computer Science - theory, design and implementation. Using a combination of:
* [Computer Science Algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) course from Khan Academy 
* [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230)by Aditya Bhargava
* [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena-ebook/dp/B00B8139Z8/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) by Steven S Skiena

Most algorithm implementations are written in **both** Python and Javascript.

## Use of Built-In Language Features:
Many of the algorithms could be made far more efficient/cleaner/generally better by using **built-in** language features -> map, reduce, itertools etc. However I have not used these in order to *learn* how these algorithms actually work.
